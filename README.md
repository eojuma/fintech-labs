# 🏦 African Vault — Mobile Banking System

A production-grade mobile banking backend built from scratch in Go. African Vault is a learning project that teaches the internals of modern banking systems — ledger design, atomic transactions, session management, payment integrations, and security engineering.

> Built at Zone01 Kisumu — where we understand the *why* before writing the code.

## 📈 The Journey

### Phase 1 — Foundation
- Basic account creation and balance tracking
- In-memory storage with Go maps
- Simple deposit and withdrawal logic

### Phase 2 — Persistence & Integrity
- Migrated from maps to SQLite via GORM
- Atomic DB transactions — money never gets lost mid-operation
- Soft delete system preserving financial audit trails
- Clean architecture — models, services, handlers, router

### Phase 3 — Security Engineering
- Secure session management with random 32-byte token generation
- 10-minute inactivity timeout with browser warning popup
- Login rate limiting — 5 attempts before 15-minute lockout
- Timing attack prevention on authentication
- Secure cookie flags — HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- 4-digit transaction PIN separate from login password
- Suspended accounts blocked at login with session invalidation
- Admin cannot block their own account

### Phase 4 — Banking Features (Current)
- Multi-account support — current and savings accounts per user
- Transfer by phone number or account number
- Account statements — PDF and CSV download with date range selection
- User profile management — update contact details, change password, change PIN
- Balance visibility toggle
- Transaction receipts with unique reference numbers
- Transaction search, filtering and pagination
- Email notifications on every transaction
- SMS notifications via Africa's Talking
- Admin audit log tracking every admin action
- Transaction reports and analytics with 7-day chart
- Automated suspicious transaction flagging

## 🚨 Fraud Detection Rules

Transactions are automatically flagged when:

| Rule | Threshold |
|------|-----------|
| Large single transaction | Amount ≥ KES 100,000 |
| Rapid successive transactions | 3 or more transactions within 5 minutes |
| Large withdrawal relative to balance | Withdrawal ≥ 80% of account balance |

Flagged transactions appear on the admin dashboard for review.

---

## 🗄️ Data Safety

- `.db` and `.env` files excluded from git via `.gitignore`
- Soft deletes via GORM DeletedAt — financial records never deleted
- Atomic DB transactions on every financial operation
- All session records cleaned up on logout and account suspension
- Every transaction has a unique reference number for tracing
- Admin audit log is permanent and never deletable
